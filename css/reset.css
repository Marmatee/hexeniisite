Apparently many mobile devices (mobile safari included)
style heading tags (h1-h6) with something like font-weight:
bold. If the font you are using doesn’t include a bold
weight, then the browser will create a faux bold and offset
that. Yup – super ugly. What’s the remedy? You should be
able to include this code either in your reset stylesheet
or your style.css

Hopefully that's explained!
