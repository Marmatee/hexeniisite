## Credits

## Compatibility
- Works 100% in Chrome and Opera
- Works to a perfectly useable level in IE, Firefox and Edge
- ~Mobile works fine iOS and apparently Android too~
- Safari on Mac looks a like a mess, need to write CSS for it

## Mobile
- Version 0.1 iPhone 5/5S

## Next steps?
- Make it work on Safari
- Stop the techno rave glowing magic symbols in Edge

## Cosmetic stuff to be done
- Record my own video for the background on index.html
- Take maybe 4 or 5 screenshots of all of the hubs and put them on the screenshots page
- Write my own content instead of using stock wiki stuff!
